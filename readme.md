### Studying the gender bias in career guidance with GPT-3（Babbage version）
Using Regard metric
Fine-tuning model has effect and we found the Regard metric is context-depandent.
This is the guide to the code files.

2-9 belong to the stereotype group, showcasing bar chart analyses for specific positions. Specifically, No. 4 provides an analysis across various fields. Files ending with "negative" pertain to our initial experiments, while those ending with "Regard" represent subsequent experiments.comparison_evaluation_nurse_doctor12.pdf
